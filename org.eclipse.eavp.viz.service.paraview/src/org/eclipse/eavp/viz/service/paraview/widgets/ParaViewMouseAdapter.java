	/*-
	 * Notes on requests sent to the ParaView client for mouse movement:
	 * 
	 * The ParaView web client expects a well-defined, ordered set of events
	 * when rotating or zooming. It is of critical importance that the below
	 * guidelines be followed when sending mouse events to the web client.
	 *
	 * Rotating:
	 * 1 - Left mouse is pressed
	 *   action - down
	 *   states - buttonLeft must be true, all else false
	 *   x,y    - should be the current cursor location, both normalized
	 * 2 - Mouse moves (this may repeat any number of times)
	 *   action - move
	 *   states - buttonLeft must be true, all else false
	 *   x,y    - should be the current cursor location, both normalized
	 * 3 - Left mouse is released
	 *   action - up
	 *   states - all states should be false
	 *   x,y    - should be the current cursor location, both normalized
	 * 
	 * Zooming:
	 * 1 - Right mouse + CTRL is pressed (alternatively, when scrolling starts)
	 *   action - down
	 *   states - buttonRight and ctrlKey should be true, all else false
	 *   x,y    - y should be the current zoom ratio, normalized. x is 0.
	 * 2 - Mouse moves (this may repeat any number of times)
	 *   action - move
	 *   states - buttonRight and ctrlKey should be true, all else false
	 *   x,y    - y should be the current zoom ratio, normalized. x is 0.
	 * 3 - Right mouse + CTRL is released (alternatively, when scrolling stops)
	 *   action - up
	 *   states - all states should be false
	 *   x,y    - y should be the current zoom ratio, normalized. x is 0.
	 * 
	 * In our code below, we adhere to these by using the following mechanisms:
	 * 
	 * Mouse movement is handled as expected using mouseDown(...), 
	 * mouseMove(...), and mouseUp(...).
	 * 
	 * Zooming is instead associated with the scroll wheel. As there is only a 
	 * mouseScrolled(...) event and no scroll equivalent to mouseDown(...) or 
	 * mouseUp(...), we instead must apply the following changes:
	 * 
	 * On the first scroll (using a boolean flag) -- send a zoom start event 
	 * (step 1) followed by a zoom event (step 2).
	 * On subsequent scrolls -- send a zoom event (step 2).
	 * On the next non-scroll event -- send a zoom end event (step 3).
	 */

	// TODO I'm not sure how well this works if you try zooming and rotating at
	// the same time.
